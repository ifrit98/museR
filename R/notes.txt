I LIKE MAKING PACKAGES AND BUILDING NEAT THINGS THAT ARE AESTHETICALLY & FUNCTIONALLY PLEASING

"Slice" of n-D tensor of the "object" that contains all the symmetries
  as lower dimensional sub-objects.

Vector space (or modular space) of enharmonic nodes -2D grid of base notes/sonority roots


Webern and matmul, sloniminsky "grandmother" chord idea to derive (a)symmetrical
embedded shapes
 - TODO: Implement grandmother chord functions to return variations


Identify all shapes inside median mandala.  paths...
36 possible keys (Maj, parallel min, counter parallel min)
12 root positions - with 6 vectors
Where do the mediant mandala vertices cross? 3D models to see of `nodes of crossing`
How to describe programmatically: Angles, Vectors, Polar, Shlafli, Plato, Topology, Cartesian?

Vector calculus to describe locations? -> arrows to 12 or 36 `base nodes`
Angles (deg/rad) for 12 base nodes, {-1, 0, +1} for parallel min, maj, counter parallel min
--Think gyroscope--
(x, y)
x <- 12 positions { C, Db, D, Eb, E, F, F#, G, Ab, A, Bb, B } (angle? regressed value)
- Scale angles between (0, 1) -> e.g. 90 = 0.25
y <- 3 orientations (p min/cp min/maj) { -1, 0, +1 } (tanh?)

HOT TODO:
Make neural network to learn patterns from real chord symbols, interpreted in this framework
E.g. pairs: {Bb7, Fmaj} -> {(270, 0), (120, 0)}

  Twins      Siblings          Cousins
4ths/5ths  Submediants   Chromatic Submediants

Add 4ths/5ths (twins):
Add submediants (siblings): C -> (a, e)
Add chromatic submediants:  C -> (Ab, Eb)

# DATA
Each point is a sequence:
[(x0,y0),  ..., (xn,yn)]

What are we training on and why?
Seq2seq where truth is 1 timestep ahead?
"Paths": learn basic shapes (square, triangle, circle)
Is this an unsupervised problem? (clustering, kernel regression, etc)



enums for classes
